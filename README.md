### New visualization plugins

Kibiter has several plugins installed by default, they improve the user customization and add more information to the dashboards. Clearly, they are all open source. The plugins are listed below:

- [Network plugin](https://github.com/dlumbrer/kbn_network) supports data visualization in a graph-style way.
- [Searchtables plugin](https://github.com/dlumbrer/kbn_searchtables) improves Kibiter tables by adding a search box to perform searches without applying filters.
- [Radar plugin](https://github.com/dlumbrer/kbn_radar) allows to explore the data using radar visualizations.
- [Dot plot plugin](https://github.com/dlumbrer/kbn_dotplot) empowers Kibiter with dot-plot visualizations, granting  to add metrics in both X and Y axis.
- [Polar plugin](https://github.com/dlumbrer/kbn_polar) enhances Kibiter with polar visualizations for your data.

## Version compatibility with Elasticsearch

Following the Kibana docs, you should be running Elasticsearch and Kibiter with matching version numbers. However, Kibiter will run (and log a warning) in case your Elasticsearch has a newer minor or patch number. 
Note that Kibiter won't be able to run, if your Elasticsearch has an older version number or a newer _major_ number. 

The table below shows some examples to illustrate the relationships between different types of version numbers.

| Situation                 | Example Kibiter version     | Example ES version | Outcome |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------- |------------------- | ------- |
| Versions are the same.    | 5.1.2                      | 5.1.2              | üíö OK      |
| ES patch number is newer. | 5.1.__2__                  | 5.1.__5__          | ‚ö†Ô∏è Logged warning      |
| ES minor number is newer. | 5.__1__.2                  | 5.__5__.0          | ‚ö†Ô∏è Logged warning      |
| ES major number is newer. | __5__.1.2                  | __6__.0.0          | üö´ Fatal error      |
